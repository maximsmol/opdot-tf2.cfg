!!! rate = uploadspeed * 100,000 !!!

calculation:
upload speed is usually in Mbit/s (10^6 bits/s)
rate is in B/s (bytes/s)
=>
  convert to MB/s (10^6 bytes/s): upload speed / 8
  convert to B/s  (bytes/s)     : upload speed / 8 * 10^6
  take 80% of that              : upload speed / 8 * 10^6 * 80%
=> rate = upload speed * 10^5
