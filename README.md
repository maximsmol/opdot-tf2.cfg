# opdot-tf2 overview
the modular and composable TF2 config

every part of the config is hierarchically separated into modules

due to its modularity, parts of the config are easy to reuse and compose with others

# mastercomfig
this config is a very heavily edited version of the great [mastermcomfig](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig)

# usage
download the config files and place them under `steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/opdot/cfg`

further instructions will be posted with v1.0.0
