- research world_light
  - EMIT_SURFACE LIGHTS:
  -
  - Dim emit_surface lights go in the ambient cube because there are a ton of them and they are often so dim that
  - they get filtered out by r_worldlightmin.
  -
  - (Dim) emit_surface lights only get calculated at runtime for static props because static props
  - do the full calculation of ambient lighting at runtime instead of using vrad's per-leaf
  - calculation. Vrad's calculation includes the emit_surfaces, so if we're NOT using it, then
  - we want to include emit_surface lights here.
  -
  - r_worldlightmin keeps EMIT_SURFACE lights regardless of setting
  - use r_worldlights to limit all lights
