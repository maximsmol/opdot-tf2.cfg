- autogen

ren/decals/batch
  - auto enable for >18

ren/sprays
  ? disabling should set lifetime to 0

ren/aa
  - no antialiasing line "commented due to HUD and overlay glitches, set it once and then comment it out"

ren/filtering
  ? disable trilinear when enabling aniso

ren/aa/fsaa_*
  - find proof in D3D9 doc for quality value meaning

ren/decals
  - batching vs covering vs overlap

os/nix/net
  - -NoQueuedPacketThread
  - exec net/download/filter/none.cfg // Fixes possible crash on Linux due to library segfaulting

ren/shadows/off
  - probably don't need to exec all the configs

ren/muzzle
  - does muzzle disable 1st_person muzzles as well

ren/shadows/amount
  - what does the value represent

ren/max_cpu
  - ambient_boost setting

ren/_water
  - r_ForceWaterLeaf

ren/water/force_expensive
ren/water/force_entity_reflection
  - is it really forcing it from some other value?

- _omit.cfg's

- player custom files = sprays?
- research world_light
  - EMIT_SURFACE LIGHTS:
  -
  - Dim emit_surface lights go in the ambient cube because there are a ton of them and they are often so dim that
  - they get filtered out by r_worldlightmin.
  -
  - (Dim) emit_surface lights only get calculated at runtime for static props because static props
  - do the full calculation of ambient lighting at runtime instead of using vrad's per-leaf
  - calculation. Vrad's calculation includes the emit_surfaces, so if we're NOT using it, then
  - we want to include emit_surface lights here.
  -
  - r_worldlightmin keeps EMIT_SURFACE lights regardless of setting
  - use r_worldlights to limit all lights
